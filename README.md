## Online Testing

You can test GreenTrace online without installing anything:

### Deployment Options

1. **Deploy on Vercel**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel --name food-lens-app
   ```
   This will create a URL like `food-lens-app.vercel.app`

2. **Deploy on Netlify**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   netlify deploy
   ```
   When satisfied with the preview, deploy to production:
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

### Quick Deployment

A deployment helper script is included to make the process easier:

```bash
# Run the deployment helper
node deploy.js
```

This interactive script will:
1. Build your project
2. Help you choose a deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages)
3. Guide you through the deployment process
4. Provide the URL where your app is accessible

### Quick Deployment to Vercel

To deploy to Vercel with a custom name (to avoid name conflicts):

```bash
# Run the simplified Vercel deployment script
node deploy-vercel.js
```

This script will:
1. Build your project
2. Install Vercel CLI if needed
3. Deploy with your chosen unique name
4. Provide you with a URL like https://your-chosen-name.vercel.app

### Usage Instructions for Online Version

1. Open the app link on your mobile device (recommended) or desktop
2. Grant camera permissions when prompted
3. Point your camera at a food product barcode or QR code
